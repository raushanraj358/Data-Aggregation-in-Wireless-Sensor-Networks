**This project aims at implementing data agggregation of packets to reduce the energy consumption and also to optimize the
communication overhead.**
Suppose there are 10 nodes and they are sending packets to the sink node without aggregation, the energy consumption will be high .
So to overcome this issue , i have  used the simple aggregation technique i.e SUM the packets which are in the given radius. 
In this methodology, data is processed at intermediate motes in order to reduce consumption of critical resources such as energy, computation time etc. This approach
also increases the network lifetime as it tries to reduce the energy consumption at every node.
